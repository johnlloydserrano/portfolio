                            Joining HIPE Japan on November 17, 2021, I became a part of the Walklog team, working on backend and UI design. 
                            Just a year later, at the 2022 Christmas party, I was honored with the Employee of the Year award.

                            When my journey began at HIPE Japan on November 17, 2021, I was introduced to the Walklog project. 
                            Responsible for both the backend and UI design of the Walklog project, it was initially a very hard and frustrating experience. 
                            For almost a month, I struggled as the sole handler of the Walklog project, with the language being new to me and no prior experience in Ruby and  Ruby on Rails. 
                            However, with the help of other HIPE Japan members from different teams, I was able to execute the project successfully. 
                            I dedicated myself to ensuring seamless functionality and an intuitive user experience. 
                            To my surprise and immense gratitude, at HIPE Japan's 2022 Christmas party, I was awarded Employee of the Year. 
                            This recognition, given within my first year at the company, underscored my commitment and the impact of my contributions to the team's success.
